    "question": "What is CSS BEM?",
    "answer": "The BEM methodology is another naming convention for CSS classes. The BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects. Elements and modifiers are part of the block with no standalone meaning. Here is the example of the typical syntax:\n\n```css\n/* block component */\n.block {\n}\n\n/* element */\n.block__element {\n}\n\n/* modifier */\n.block__element--modifier {\n}\n```",
    "goodToHear": [
      "Block is a top-level abstraction of a new component",
      "Elements make no sense to be alone - they are tightly dependent on blocks",
      "Modifier is a flag added to block or element so it makes them a bit more specific"

    "question": "How do you clone an object in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "Using the object spread operator `...`, the object's own enumerable properties can be copied\ninto the new object. This creates a shallow clone of the object.\n\n```js\nconst obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }\nconst shallowClone = { ...obj }\n```\n\nWith this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.\n\nOther alternatives include:\n\n* `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).\n* `Object.assign({}, obj)` is another alternative.\n* `Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})` is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.",

    "answer": "Even though two different objects can have the same properties with equal values, they are not considered equal when compared using `==` or `===`. This is because they are being compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive values which are compared by value.\n\nIn order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper function is required. It will\niterate through the own properties of each object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects.\nOptionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for equivalence by passing `true` as the 3rd argument.\n\nNote: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data structures other than\nplain objects, arrays, functions, dates and primitive values.\n\n```js\nfunction isDeepEqual(obj1, obj2, testPrototypes = false) {\n  if (obj1 === obj2) {\n    return true\n  }\n\n  if (typeof obj1 === \"function\" && typeof obj2 === \"function\") {\n    return obj1.toString() === obj2.toString()\n  }\n\n  if (obj1 instanceof Date && obj2 instanceof Date) {\n    return obj1.getTime() === obj2.getTime()\n  }\n\n  const prototypesAreEqual = testPrototypes\n    ? isDeepEqual(\n        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj1),\n        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2),\n        true\n      )\n    : true\n\n  const obj1Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1)\n  const obj2Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2)\n\n  return (\n    obj1Props.length === obj2Props.length &&\n    prototypesAreEqual &&\n    obj1Props.every(prop => isDeepEqual(obj1[prop], obj2[prop]))\n  )\n}\n```",

They provide variables for consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this functionality) and additional tools like color functions (`lighten`, `darken`, `transparentize`, etc), variables, mixins, and loops that make CSS more like a real programming language and gives the developer more power to generate complex CSS.",

    "question": "How does prototypal inheritance differ from classical inheritance?",
    "answer": "In the classical inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit their properties and functions from a class, which acts as a blueprint for the object. Object instances are typically created using a constructor and the `new` keyword.\n\nIn the prototypal inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit directly from other objects and are typically created using factory functions or `Object.create()`. Finally, object instances can be composed from many different objects, allowing for selective inheritance.",

    "answer": "Including `'use strict'` at the beginning of your JavaScript source file enables strict mode, which enfores more strict parsing and error handling of JavaScript code. It is considered a good practice and offers a lot of benefits, such as:\n\n* Easier debugging due to eliminating silent errors.\n* Disallows variable redefinition.\n* Prevents accidental global variables.\n* Oftentimes provides increased performance over identical code that is not running in strict mode.\n* Simplifies `eval()` and `arguments`.\n* Helps make JavaScript more secure.",

    "answer": "This technique is very common in JavaScript libraries. It creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries. The function is usually immediately invoked so that the namespace (library name) is assigned the return value of the function.\n\n```js\nconst myLibrary = function () {\n  var privateVariable = 2;\n  return {\n    publicMethod: () => privateVariable;\n  };\n}();\nprivateVariable; // ReferenceError\nmyLibrary.publicMethod(); // 2\n```",
