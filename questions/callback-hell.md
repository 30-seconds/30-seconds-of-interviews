### How can you avoid callback hells?

```js
getData(function(a){  
  getMoreData(a, function(b){
    getMoreData(b, function(c){ 
      getMoreData(c, function(d){ 
        getMoreData(d, function(e){ 
          //  ...
        })
      })
    })
  })
})
```

#### Answer

There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:

* modularization: break callbacks into independent functions
* use a control flow library, like async
* use generators with Promises
* use async/await (from v7 on)

#### Good to hear

* As an efficient JavaScript developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows.
