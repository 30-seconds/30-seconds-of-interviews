### What is Unit Testing ?

### Answer

Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual units or components of software are tested independently.

Tests are written using frameworks like Mocha, Chai, and Jest. The software is validated by giving it different inputs, and checking to see that the desired output is returned.
