### In Javascript, Hoisting happens to Functions and Variable declared with `var`. Where can they be scoped?

#### Answer

Either Global or Function scoped.

Unlike `let` or `const` they are not Block scoped and can only exist in one of two places because they are assigned a pointed before any evaluation of the code.

#### Good to hear

* There is more than one type of scope in Javascrit(Global, Function, Block)
* Hoisting defines the references before actually evaluating the script
